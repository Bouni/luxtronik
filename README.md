This component has been created to be used with Home Assistant.

The `Luxtronik` integration lets you control heat pump units controlled by a Luxtronik controller. It is used by various manufacturers such as:

- Alpha Innotec
- Siemens Novelan
- Roth
- Elco
- Buderus
- Nibe
- Wolf Heiztechnik

Its only necessary to connect the Luxtronik controller to your network, no additional hard- or software is needed.

## Configuration

To enable this component, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
luxtronik:
  host: 192.168.178.10
  port: 8889
```

- host
  - description: IP address or hostname of the Luxtronik controller.
  - required: true
  - type: string
- port
  - description: The port name of the Luxtronik controller.
  - required: true
  - default: 8889
  - type: integer
- safe
  - description: Enables the writing of unknown parameters if set to false.
  - required: false
  - default: true
  - type: boolean
- lock_timeout
  - description: Lock timeout for concurrent read- and write operations in seconds.
  - required: false
  - default: 30
  - type: integer
- update_immediately_after_write
  - description: Update sensor data after every write operation
  - required: false
  - default: false
  - type: boolean

**Note:**

Not all data received by the Luxronik controller is understood by now as the protocol is not publicly documented.  

## Parameter IDs

Take these files as a reference to figure ot which IDs to use:

- https://github.com/Bouni/python-luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/parameters.py
- https://github.com/Bouni/python-luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/calculations.py
- https://github.com/Bouni/python-luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/visibilities.py

## Service

In order to change parameters on the Luxtronik conroller, you can use the following service:

```yaml
Domain: luxtronik
Service: write
Service Data: {"parameter": "ID_Ba_Hz_akt", "value": "Automatic"}
```

- parameter
  - description: ID of the parameter.
  - type: string
- value
  - description: Value you want to set the parameter to.
  - type: [string, float]

Only a small number of the over 1100 parameters have a known funtion and only these can be written, these are:

- `ID_Ba_Hz_akt` The mode of operation of the heating circuit, possible values are "Automatic", "Second heatsource", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Ba_Bw_akt` The mode of operation of the hot water circuit, possible valus are "Automatic", "Second heatsource", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Soll_BWS_akt` The set point for hot water generation, for example 50.0 for 50.0°C 
- `ID_Einst_BA_Kuehl_akt` The mode of operation of the cooling circuit, possible values are "Automatic", "Off"
- `ID_Einst_KuehlFreig_akt` The outdoor temprature from wher on the cooling should start to operate, for example 24.0 
- `ID_Ba_Sw_akt` The mode of operation of the swimming pool heating circuit, possible values are "Automatic", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Einst_TDC_Max_akt` Max. temperature difference of the hot water buffer tank, for example 70.0
- `ID_Sollwert_KuCft1_akt` Cooling set point for mixer circuit 1, for example 19.0
- `ID_Sollwert_KuCft2_akt` Cooling set point for mixer circuit 2, for example 19.0
- `ID_Sollwert_AtDif1_akt` Cooling working temperature difference 1, for example 5.0
- `ID_Sollwert_AtDif2_akt` Cooling working temperature difference 2, for example 5.0
- `ID_Ba_Hz_MK3_akt` The mode of operation of the heating mixer circuit 3, possible values are "Automatic", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Einst_Kuhl_Zeit_Ein_akt` Cooling outdoor temperature overrun, for example 0.0
- `ID_Einst_Kuhl_Zeit_Aus_akt` Cooling outdoor temperature underrun, for example 0.0
- `ID_Einst_Solar_akt` Mode of operation for solar heat generation, "Automatic", "Second heatsource", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Einst_BA_Lueftung_akt` Mode of operation of the integrated ventilation unit, posisble values are "Automatic", "Party", "Holidays", "Off"
- `ID_Sollwert_KuCft3_akt` Cooling set point for mixer circuit 3, for example 20.0
- `ID_Sollwert_AtDif3_akt` Cooling working temperature difference 3, for example 5.0

**Note:**

Before changing a parameter it smart to first read the current value and note it somewhere in case you want to set it back to its original value.
All parameters can be configured as sensors and read that way.
If you want to write unknown parameters, set the config option `safe` to `false`.

## Sensor

The Luxtronik sensor platform allows you to monitor the status values of a heat pump unit controlled by a Luxtronik controller.

Sensors are read-only. To write to the heatpump, use the provided service Luxtronik Integration - Service.

To use a Luxtronik sensor in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: luxtronik
    sensors:
      - group: calculations
        id: ID_WEB_Temperatur_TVL
```

- group:
  - description: Value group where the ID is located, possible values are `calculations`, `parameters`, `visibilities`.
  - required: true
  - type: string
- id:
  - description: The id of the value.
  - required: true
  - type: string
- friendly_name:
  - description: Sets a meaningful name for the sensor, if not provided the sensor will be named after the id, `luxtronik.id_webemperatur_tvl` for example, otherwise `luxtronik.temperature_forerun`.
  - required: false
  - type: string
- icon:
  - description: Set an icon for the sensor
  - required: false
  - type: string

## Full example

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: luxtronik
    sensors:
      - group: calculations
        id: ID_WEB_Temperatur_TVL
        friendly_name: Temperature forerun
        icon: mdi:thermometer
```

## Binary Sensor

The Luxtronik binary sensor platform allows you to monitor the status values of a heat pump unit controlled by a Luxtronik controller.

Binary sensors are read-only. To write to the heatpump, use the provided service Luxtronik Integration - Service.

To use a Luxtronik binary sensor in your installation, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: luxtronik
    sensors:
      - group: calculations
        id: ID_WEB_EVUin
```

- group:
  - description: Value group where the ID is located, possible values are `calculations`, `parameters`, `visibilities`.
  - required: true
  - type: string
- id:
  - description: The id of the value.
  - required: true
  - type: string
- friendly_name:
  - description: Sets a meaningful name for the sensor, if not provided the sensor will be named after the id, `luxtronik.id_web_evuin` for example, otherwise `luxtronik.utility_company_lock`.
  - required: false
  - type: string
- icon:
  - description: Set an icon for the sensor
  - required: false
  - type: string
- invert:
  - description: Inverts the value
  - required: false
  - type: boolean
  - default: false

## Full example

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
binary_sensor:
  - platform: luxtronik
    sensors:
      - group: calculations
        id: ID_WEB_EVUin
        friendly_name: Utility company lock
        icon: mdi:lock
```
